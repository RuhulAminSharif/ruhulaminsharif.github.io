<div style="text-align: justify;">
  <p>
  I'm a Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student at Premier University, Chittagong, with a passion for building systems that can see and understand the world. My primary focus is on Computer Vision and the cutting-edge field of Egocentric AI (first-person vision). I'm fascinated by the challenge of analyzing data from a first-person perspective to understand human activities and interactions. I completed key coursework in areas such as Data Structures & Algorithms, Machine Learning, Artiicial Intilligence, Computer Graphics and Image Processing, which solidified my foundation in these fields.
